- NativeColorBlock for usage in a StreamField
- Based on the native HTML5 color picker
- A custom db field for improved validation

from wagtail.core.models import Page

from wagtail_color_panel.fields import ColorField
from wagtail_color_panel.panels import NativeColorPanel
# For wagtail version < 3:
# from wagtail_color_panel.edit_handlers import NativeColorPanel


class MyPage(Page):
    color = ColorField()

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        NativeColorPanel('color'),
    ]
```
